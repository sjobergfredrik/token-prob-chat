# Token Probability Chat

This application provides a simple chat interface that displays token-level probabilities from an LLM (Language Learning Model). It uses color-coding (stoplight colors) to indicate the model's confidence in each token and provides detailed probability information on hover.

## Features

- Send prompts to OpenAI's API
- Retrieve token-level probability data
- Display generated text token by token
- Color-code tokens based on confidence level:
  - Green: High confidence (â‰¥50%)
  - Yellow: Medium confidence (20-49%)
  - Red: Low confidence (<20%)
- Show detailed token probabilities and alternatives on hover

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Enter a prompt in the input field
2. Click "Send" to submit the prompt to the OpenAI API
3. View the generated response with color-coded tokens
4. Hover over any token to see detailed probability information

## Technical Details

- Uses OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model with logprobs parameter
- Converts log probabilities to regular probabilities for easier interpretation
- Implements tooltips using Tippy.js

## Notes

- The OpenAI API key is required for this application to work
- The application uses the text-davinci-003 model which supports the logprobs parameter
- Token-level probabilities provide insight into the model's confidence in its output

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
